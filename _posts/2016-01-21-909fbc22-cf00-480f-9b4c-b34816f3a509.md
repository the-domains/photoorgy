Jon Ottoson

I once had a girl  
Or should I say she once had me  
She showed me her room  
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay  
And she told me to sit anywhere  
So I looked around  
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on the rug biding my time  
Drinking her wine  
We talked until two and then she said  
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked  
In the morning and started to laugh  
I told her I didn't  
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
